Each jump consumes a burst of fuel, so the armor must be reloaded after several uses.  Unlike most ultratech military units, locusts train primarily with melee weapons. They usually avoid static shootouts, preferring to jump straight into enemy fortifications and fight hand-to-hand. They do poorly in static defense or confined quarters, but excel in mixed cover or shipcracking operations.",

Pressed into the back of the throat, the unit injects itself through the flesh to clamp inside the base of the skull where it meets the spinal cord. There, it threads a web of ultrafine wires throughout nearby neuronal tissue to make the direct mental link between the user and the mechanoid control band.  Mechlinks are not simply devices for sending radio signals to mechanoids, because mechanoids are not merely robots. In addition to traditional computers, mechanoids have a dim psychic presence, so fluently controlling them requires a psychic connection. By linking mechanitor and mechanoid both psychically and electromagnetically, the mechlink permits deeper control than screen-and-button interfaces.  Since the mechlink interlaces deep within the brain tissue, it can only be removed after death.  Note: A mechanitor must be capable of smithing work to gestate mechanoids.",

Due to the irreparable physiological damage it causes, the servitor module cannot be removed safely once it’s been installed.  Upon finishing reconditioning the host it provides the following benefits.  Provides +1000 mood. Removes the feeling of pain. Removes the need for recreation. Removes the need for rest.

A rather slow and filthy hybrid of this category, but it works very well as a ride due to the multiple legs easing the burden of long distance travel inherent to caravaning.

Your researchers need the foundational knowledge offered by techprints to know where to start on a given technology. Only after enough techprints have been applied can your researchers work out the fine details of how to make use of the technology in your particular situation.  Applying techprints to a satisfied project fulfills half the remaining research progress. In addition, researchers always gain a boost to their intellectual skills when applying techprints, even on already-completed technologies.
